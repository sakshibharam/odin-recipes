    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Cake</h4>
    <ul>
       <li>Baking spray with flour</li> 
       <li>2 cups cake flour</li> 
       <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
       <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
       <li>1 (20-ounce) can crushed pineapple in juice</li>
       <li>2 cups chopped peeled carrots</li>
       <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
       <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
       <li>1 1/4 cups firmly packed brown sugar</li>
       <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
       <li>1/4 cup sour cream, at room temperature</li>
       <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
       <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
       <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
       <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
       <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
       <li>1 cup grated carrot</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Glaze</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ounces full fat cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups confectioner's sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons whole milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Spray a 10-cup Bundt pan with a baking spray containing flour.</li>
        <li>Sift together cake flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place a fine mesh strainer over another large bowl. Pour crushed pineapple into the strainer, and use the back of a spatula or wooden spoon to press out as much moisture as possible. This should yield about 1 cup drained pineapple. Reserve pineapple juice for another use.</li>
        <li>Place chopped carrots, melted butter, and oil into the cup of a high-speed blender. Blend on high speed until mixture is smooth and no large clumps of carrot remain, 1 to 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Add in half of drained pineapple, brown sugar, eggs, sour cream, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg, and cloves. Blend on high speed until mixture is smooth and combined, stopping to scrape down sides as needed, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour carrot mixture into the bowl with flour mixture. Whisk until no large clumps of flour remain. Stir in remaining drained pineapple and grated carrot until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into the prepared Bundt pan and tap pan on the counter a few times to release any large air bubbles.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out with a few moist crumbs, 45 to 55 minutes. Allow cake to cool in the pan for 15 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely, about 45 minutes more.</li>
        <li>For glaze, combine cream cheese, powdered sugar, milk, vanilla, and salt in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until smooth. If glaze is too thick, add more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until glaze is pourable. Pour glaze over cooled cake.</li>
    </ol>
